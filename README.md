:page_with_curl: About me :


- Iâ€™m Spartak,
a curious technologist having an educational background in business, engineering and computer science. 
It was quite foreseeable that I would end up within the IT industry...

- My enthusiasm for data and analytics started when I discovered the field of Econometrics at University.
Having statistical tools serving as a basis for analytics & prediction seemed almost wizardry to me.
I have since then aimed my time and focus on studying data related fields and trying to get as polyvalent as possible.

- Iâ€™m currently learning ETL, Data Warehousing, Data Modelling 


:chart_with_upwards_trend: Latest accomplishments : 

- Set-up AWS based infrastructure of data pipelines that fetch from multiple sources on a 24x7 basis. 

- Used Terraform to manage and automate multiples AWS instances.

- Setting up ETL/Data Pipelines for acquisition and transformation of data to make it available for other teams

+ Quite up-to-date with the latest trends in the field of Information Technology and Business.

+ Ability to find out business problems and provide the best-fit solution.
